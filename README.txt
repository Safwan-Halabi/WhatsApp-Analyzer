This is a simple project about WhatsApp group chat data analyzer.

You simply need to use the "Export Chat" option that WhatsApp provides and upload it to the WEB app, the app will then show you an analysis of the group chat including how many messages each person sent, the amount of times each emoji was sent and a timeline showing chat activity over the years.

To run the app simply have all the requirements found in the requirements.txt file in your environment and then run the following command:

streamlit run app.py

Streamlit should then open a new browser tab on your localhost.

To shutdown the app simply cancel the process in your cmd (usually ctrl+C).
